General Vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia in older adults after Alzheimer's disease, and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) result from injuries to vessels that supply blood to the brain, often after a stroke or series of strokes. The symptoms of vascular dementia can be similar to those of Alzheimer's, and both conditions can occur at the same time (a condition called \"mixed dementia\"). Symptoms of vascular dementia and VCI can begin suddenly and worsen or improve over time.Caregivers of people with vascular dementia or VCI face a variety of challenges. Learning more about these disorders can help. This resource list is a place to start. All resources on this list are available free online.The items on this list are in three categories:- Vascular Dementia and Vascular Cognitive Impairment - CADASIL-a rare, inherited form of vascular dementia - Binswanger's Disease-also called Subcortical Vascular Dementia Vascular Dementia and Vascular Cognitive Impairment The Brain Needs Blood (February-March 2013)This Neurology Now magazine article offers an overview of the relationship between vascular events or disease (including stroke and mini-stroke) and cognitive impairment.

Help them have good quality of life as they're dying. General As they reach the end of life, people suffering from dementia can present special challenges for caregivers. People can live with diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's dementia for years, so it can be hard to think of these as terminal diseases. But, they do cause death. Hard Decisions Dementia causes the gradual loss of thinking, remembering, and reasoning abilities, making it difficult for those who want to provide supportive care at the end of life to know what is needed. Because people with advanced dementia can no longer communicate clearly, they cannot share their concerns. Is Uncle Bert refusing food because he's not hungry or because he's confused? Why does Grandma Sakura seem agitated? Is she in pain and needs medication to relieve it, but can't tell you?As these conditions progress, caregivers may find it hard to provide emotional or spiritual comfort. How can you let Grandpa know how much his life has meant to you? How do you make peace with your mother if she no longer knows who you are? Someone who has severe memory loss might not take spiritual comfort from sharing family memories or understand when others express what an important part of their life this person has been. Palliative care or hospice can be helpful in many ways to families of people with dementia.Sensory connections-targeting someone's senses, like hearing, touch, or sight-can bring comfort. Being touched or massaged can be soothing. Listening to music, white noise, or sounds from nature seem to relax some people and lessen their agitation.When a dementia like Alzheimer's disease is first diagnosed, if everyone understands that there is no cure, then plans for the end of life can be made before thinking and speaking abilities fail and the person with Alzheimer's can no longer legally complete documents like advance directives.Learn more about legal and financial planning for people with Alzheimer's disease.End-of-life care decisions are more complicated for caregivers if the dying person has not expressed the kind of care he or she would prefer. Someone newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease might not be able to imagine the later stages of the disease. Weighing Care Choices Quality of life is an important issue when making healthcare decisions for people with dementia. For example, medicines are available that may delay or keep symptoms from becoming worse for a little while. Medicines also may help control some behavioral symptoms in people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.However, some caregivers might not want drugs prescribed for people in the later stages of Alzheimer's. They may believe that the person's quality of life is already so poor that the medicine is unlikely to make a difference. If the drug has serious side effects, they may be even more likely to decide against it.When making care decisions for someone else near the end of life, consider the goals of care and weigh the benefits, risks, and side effects of the treatment. You may have to make a treatment decision based on the person's comfort at one end of the spectrum and extending life or maintaining abilities for a little longer at the other.With dementia, a person's body may continue to be physically healthy while his or her thinking and memory are deteriorating. This means that caregivers and family members may be faced with very difficult decisions about how treatments that maintain physical health, such as installing a pacemaker, fit within the care goals. Dementia\u2019s Unpredictable Progression Dementia often progresses slowly and unpredictably. Experts suggest that signs of the final stage of Alzheimer's disease include some of the following:- Being unable to move around on one's own - Being unable to speak or make oneself understood - Needing help with most, if not all, daily activities, such as eating and self-care - Eating problems such as difficulty swallowingBecause of their unique experience with what happens at the end of life, hospice and palliative care experts might be able to help identify when someone in the final stage of Alzheimer's disease is in the last days or weeks of life. Caregiver Support Caring for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias at home can be demanding and stressful for the family caregiver. Depression is a problem for some family caregivers, as is fatigue, because many feel they are always on call. Family caregivers may have to cut back on work hours or leave work altogether because of their caregiving responsibilities.Many family members taking care of a person with advanced dementia at home feel relief when death happens-for themselves and for the person who died. It is important to realize such feelings are normal. Hospice-whether used at home or in a facility (such as a nursing home)-gives family caregivers needed support near the end of life, as well as help with their grief, both before and after their family member dies.Caregivers, ask for help when you need it. Learn about respite care.Questions to Ask About End-of-Life Care for a Person with Dementia You will want to understand how the available medical options presented by the healthcare team fit into your family's particular needs. You might want to ask questions such as: - How will the approach the doctor is suggesting affect your relative's quality of life? Will it make a difference in comfort and well-being? - If considering home hospice for your relative with dementia, what will be needed to care for him or her? Does the facility have special experience with people with dementia? - What can I expect as the disease gets worse?Read about this topic in Spanish. Lea sobre este tema en espanol. WHAT IS MIXED DEMENTIA? Read about mixed dementia, a combination of two or more disorders. For example, older adults with dementia may have Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. General It is common for people to have mixed dementia-a combination of two or more disorders, at least one of which is dementia. A number of combinations are possible. For example, some people have both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.Some studies indicate that mixed dementia is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. For example, autopsy studies looking at the brains of people who had dementia indicate that most people age 80 and older had mixed dementia-a combination of brain changes related to Alzheimer's disease (amyloid and tau), cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke), and, in some instances, Lewy body dementia (Lewy bodies). These studies suggest that mixed dementia is caused by both Alzheimer's-related neurodegenerative processes and vascular disease-related processes.In a person with mixed dementia, it may not be clear exactly how many of a person's symptoms are due to Alzheimer's or another type of dementia. In one study, approximately 40 percent of people who were thought to have Alzheimer's were found after autopsy to also have some form of cerebrovascular disease. In addition, several studies have found that many of the major risk factors for vascular disease also may be risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.Researchers are still working to understand how underlying disease processes in mixed dementia influence each other. It is not clear, for example, if symptoms are likely to be worse when a person has brain changes reflecting multiple types of dementia. Nor do we know if a person with multiple dementias can benefit from treating one type, for example, when a person with Alzheimer's controls high blood pressure and other vascular disease risk factors.

Nor do we know if a person with multiple dementias can benefit from treating one type, for example, when a person with Alzheimer's controls high blood pressure and other vascular disease risk factors. WHAT IS VASCULAR DEMENTIA? Vascular dementia differs from Alzheimer's disease in that it is caused by stroke. Learn about types of vascular dementia as well as treatment. General Vascular dementia, considered the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) result from injuries to the vessels supplying blood to the brain, often after a stroke or series of strokes. Vascular dementia and VCI arise as a result of risk factors that similarly increase the risk for cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke), including atrial fibrillation, hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, and high cholesterol. The symptoms of vascular dementia can be similar to those of Alzheimer's, and both conditions can occur at the same time. Symptoms of vascular dementia can begin suddenly and worsen or improve during one's lifetime.This type of dementia is often managed with drugs to prevent strokes. The aim is to reduce the risk of additional brain damage. Some studies suggest that drugs that improve memory in Alzheimer's disease might benefit people with early vascular dementia. Interventions that address risk factors may be incorporated into the management of vascular dementia.Some types of vascular dementia include:Multi-infarct dementia. This type of dementia occurs when a person has had many small strokes that damage brain cells. One side of the body may be disproportionally affected, and multi-infarct dementia may impair language or other functions, depending on the region of the brain that is affected. When the strokes occur on both sides of the brain, dementia is more likely than when stroke occurs on one side of the brain. In some cases, a single stroke can damage the brain enough to cause dementia. This so-called single-infarct dementia is more common when stroke affects the left side of the brain-where speech centers are located-and/or when it involves the hippocampus, the part of the brain that is vital for memory.Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). This inherited form of cardiovascular disease results in a thickening of the walls of small- and medium-sized blood vessels, eventually stemming the flow of blood to the brain. It is associated with mutations of a gene called Notch3. CADASIL is associated with multi-infarct dementia, stroke, migraine with aura (migraine preceded by visual symptoms), and mood disorders. The first symptoms can appear in people between ages 20 and 40. Many people with CADASIL are undiagnosed. People with first-degree relatives who have CADASIL can be tested for genetic mutations to the Notch3 gene to determine their own risk of developing CADASIL.Subcortical vascular dementia, also called Binswanger's disease. This rare form of dementia involves extensive damage to the small blood vessels and nerve fibers that make up white matter, the \"network\" part of the brain believed to be critical for relaying messages between regions. The symptoms of Binswanger's are related to the disruption of subcortical neural circuits involving short-term memory, organization, mood, attention, decision making, and appropriate behavior. A characteristic feature of this disease is psychomotor slowness, such as an increase in the time it takes for a person to think of a letter and then write it on a piece of paper.For more information about vascular dementia and VCI, see NIA's list of resources.

GETTING HELP WITH ALZHEIMER'S CAREGIVING Looking for respite care or help with Alzheimer's caregiving? Learn about supportive resources like home care, adult day care, meal services, and hospice. General Some caregivers need help when the person is in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Other caregivers look for help when the person is in the later stages of Alzheimer's. It's okay to seek help whenever you need it.As the person moves through the stages of Alzheimer's, he or she will need more care. One reason is that medicines used to treat Alzheimer's disease can only control symptoms; they cannot cure the disease. Symptoms, such as memory loss and confusion, will get worse over time.Because of this, you will need more help. You may feel that asking for help shows weakness or a lack of caring, but the opposite is true. Asking for help shows your strength. It means you know your limits and when to seek support. Build a Support System According to many caregivers, building a local support system is a key way to get help. Your support system might include a caregiver support group, the local chapter of the Alzheimer's Association, family, friends, and faith groups. Resources for Alzheimer\u2019s Care Here are some places that can give you support and advice:NIA Alzheimer's and related Dementias Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center Email: adear@nia.nih.gov Phone: 1-800-438-4380 www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers The ADEAR Center offers information on diagnosis, treatment, patient care, caregiver needs, long-term care, and research and clinical trials related to Alzheimer's disease.

Learn about other dementias, including Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal disorders, vascular dementia, and mixed dementia. General Various disorders and factors contribute to the development of dementia. Neurodegenerative disorders result in a progressive and irreversible loss of neurons and brain functioning. Currently, there are no cures for these types of disorders. They include:- Alzheimer's disease - Frontotemporal disorders - Lewy body dementiaOther types of progressive brain disease include:- Vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment - Mixed dementia, a combination of two or more disorders, at least one of which is dementiaOther types of dementia can often be halted or even reversed with treatment. For example, normal pressure hydrocephalus, an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, often resolves with treatment.In addition, certain medical conditions can cause serious memory problems that resemble dementia. These problems should go away once the conditions are treated. These conditions include:- Side effects of certain medicines - Depression - Certain vitamin deficiencies - Drinking too much alcohol - Blood clots or tumors in the brain - Head injury, such as a concussion from a fall or accident - Thyroid, kidney, or liver problemsDoctors have identified many other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms. These conditions include:- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare brain disorder - Huntington's disease, a hereditary disorder caused by a faulty gene - Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repeated traumatic brain injury - Subdural hematoma, bleeding between the brain's surface and its outer coveringThe overlap in symptoms of various dementias can make it hard to get an accurate diagnosis. But a proper diagnosis is important to get the right treatment. Seek help from a neurologist-a doctor who specializes in disorders of the brain and nervous system-or other medical specialist who knows about dementia.Learn more about dementia from MedlinePlus.

WHAT IS DEMENTIA? Dementia is a loss of thinking, remembering, and reasoning skills that interferes with a person's daily life and activities. While dementia is more common with advanced age, it is not a normal part of aging. Learn why. General Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning-thinking, remembering, and reasoning-and behavioral abilities to such an extent that it interferes with a person's daily life and activities. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person's functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for basic activities of living.Signs and symptoms of dementia result when once-healthy neurons (nerve cells) in the brain stop working, lose connections with other brain cells, and die. While everyone loses some neurons as they age, people with dementia experience far greater loss.While dementia is more common as people grow older (up to half of all people age 85 or older may have some form of dementia), it is not a normal part of aging. Many people live into their 90s and beyond without any signs of dementia. One type of dementia, frontotemporal disorders, is more common in middle-aged than older adults.Memory loss, though common, is not the only sign of dementia. For a person to have dementia, he or she must have:- Two or more core mental functions that are impaired. These functions include memory, language skills, visual perception, and the ability to focus and pay attention. These also include cognitive skills such as the ability to reason and solve problems. - A loss of brain function severe enough that a person cannot do normal, everyday tasksIn addition, some people with dementia cannot control their emotions. Their personalities may change. They can have delusions, which are strong beliefs without proof, such as the idea that someone is stealing from them. They also may hallucinate, seeing or otherwise experiencing things that are not real.The causes of dementia can vary, depending on the types of brain changes that may be taking place. Other dementias include Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal disorders, and vascular dementia. It is common for people to have mixed dementia-a combination of two or more disorders, at least one of which is dementia. For example, some people have both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.Learn more about dementia from MedlinePlus.

ASSESSING CHANGES IN MEMORY AND FUNCTION When visiting an aging relative, you might notice they have more memory problems than last time. Find info to help you assess changes in memory and cognition. General If you do not see an aging friend or relative often, changes in his or her health may seem dramatic. In contrast, the primary caregiver might not notice such changes or realize that more help, medical treatment, or supervision is needed. Or, the primary caregiver might not want to accept the fact that the health of his or her spouse or parent is failing. Sometimes a geriatric care manager or other professional is the first to notice changes.For families dealing with Alzheimer's disease or another dementia, it can be easier to cover for the person-doing things for him or her, filling in information in conversations, and so on-than to acknowledge what is happening.As a caregiver, you can provide support by helping an aging friend or relative get the care they need.A few good questions to help you start the conversation with the primary caregiver are:- If you thought there might be a change in Aunt Joan's condition, whose opinion would you seek? - I didn't notice Dad repeating himself so much the last time I was here. Do you remember when it started?Some changes may not be what you think. Occasional forgetfulness does not necessarily indicate dementia. Before you raise the issue of what needs to be done, talk to your parent and the primary caregiver about your concerns.Try not to sound critical when you raise the subject. Instead, mention your particular worry, for example, \"Mom, it looks like you don't have much food in the house-are you having trouble getting to the store?\" and explain why you are asking. Listen to what the primary caregiver says about the situation and whether he or she believes there are problems.Discuss what you think could be done. For example, you could ask:- Would you like me to arrange to have groceries delivered on a regular basis? - Do we need to get a second opinion about the diagnosis? - Can you follow the medication schedule? - Would you like some help with housework?Try to follow your suggestions with practical help, and give specific examples of what you can do. For example, you might arrange to have a personal or home health aide come in once a week. You might schedule doctors' appointments or arrange for transportation.In some cases, you may have to be forceful, especially if you feel that the situation is unhealthy or unsafe. Do not leave a frail adult at risk. If you have to act against the wishes of your parent or the primary caregiver, be direct and explain what you are going to do. Discuss your plan, and say why you are taking action.Find more tips for long-distance caregivers. DIAGNOSING DEMENTIA Doctors diagnose dementia-including Alzheimer disease, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia-with brain scans and other tests. General To diagnose dementia, doctors first assess whether a person has an underlying treatable condition such as depression, abnormal thyroid function, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or vitamin B12 deficiency. Early diagnosis is important, as some causes for symptoms can be treated. In many cases, the specific type of dementia a person has may not be confirmed until after the person has died and the brain is examined.A medical assessment for dementia generally includes:- Patient history. Typical questions about a person's medical and family history might include asking about whether dementia runs in the family, how and when symptoms began, changes in behavior and personality, and if the person is taking certain medications that might cause or worsen symptoms. - Physical exam. Measuring blood pressure and other vital signs may help physicians detect conditions that might cause or occur with dementia. Such conditions may be treatable. - Neurological tests. Assessing balance, sensory function, reflexes, vision, eye movements, and other cognitive functions helps identify conditions that may affect the diagnosis or are treatable with drugs. Tests Used to Diagnose Dementia The following procedures also may be used to diagnose dementia:- Cognitive and neuropsychological tests. These tests measure memory, problem solving, attention, counting, language skills, and other abilities related to mental functioning. - Laboratory tests. Blood and urine tests can help find or rule out possible causes of symptoms. - Brain scans. These tests can identify strokes, tumors, and other problems that can cause dementia. Scans also identify changes in the brain's structure and function. The most common scans are: - Computed tomography (CT), which uses X-rays to produce images of the brain and other organs - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of body structures, including tissues, organs, bones, and nerves - Positron emission tomography (PET), which uses radiation to provide pictures of brain activity - Psychiatric evaluation. This evaluation will help determine if depression or another mental health condition is causing or contributing to a person's symptoms. - Genetic tests. Some dementias are caused by a known gene defect. In these cases, a genetic test can help people know if they are at risk for dementia. People should talk with family members, a primary care doctor, and a genetic counselor before getting tested. Who Can Diagnose Dementia? Visiting a family doctor is often the first step for people who are experiencing changes in thinking, movement, or behavior. However, neurologists-doctors who specialize in disorders of the brain and nervous system-generally have the expertise needed to diagnose dementia. Geriatric psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and geriatricians may also be skilled in diagnosing the condition.If a specialist cannot be found in your community, ask the neurology department of the nearest medical school for a referral. A hospital affiliated with a medical school may also have a dementia or movement disorders clinic that provides expert evaluation. ")
